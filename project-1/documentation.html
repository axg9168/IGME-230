            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The process of making this game consisted of first figuring out what kind of game I wanted to make. 
            Once I knew I wanted to make a puzzle game, the next decision was the theme. I chose a space theme because I have always found space to be very fascinating, 
            and more recently I played the game Kingdom Hearts 3, which contains a minigame where the player has to find constellations in space. Finally, I had to think of a name for my game. 
            I wanted a name that meant something along the lines of "matching things in the sky". My initial idea for the name was Galactic Harmony, because the player needs to "harmonize" constellations in a galactic area. 
            This name felt just a bit too long, so I looked for words similar to the previous words. I ended with the words "sync" and "space", but the name didn't quite roll off the tongue very well. 
            That's when I decided to change "sync" to "synchro", making the name much nicer to say.</p>
            
            <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
            <p>For this website, I did not look at the requirements at all to begin. I started off by creating a site that was made the way I wanted it to be. Once I got that done, 
            I looked at the requirements, and checked off what I already had. From there, it was easy to add or take away the things I needed in order to satisfy the requirements.</p>
            <p>In no particular order, the requirements for this website included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An HTML file for the project overview, proposal, documentation, and game.</li>
                <li>An external CSS file to control each page.</li>
                <li>Use of HTML structure tags such as &#60;header&#62;, &#60;article&#62;, &#60;section&#62;, and others</li>
                <li>One image on the Overview page, and two images on the Proposal page.</li>
            </ul>
